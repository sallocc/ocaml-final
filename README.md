Opam dependencies
- Need to download dream. This can be done through an opam command "opam install dream.1.0.0~alpha2"
- To execute the dream website run the command "dune exec --root . ./src/main.exe" in the top-level directory
- If a dune-project file appears in the src folder, please delete before running tests as that will mess up the project dependencies
